#### Call me Jun
Hello. This is Junhyung Huh. I know it is hard to pronounce for someone. So you can call me **Jun**. 
#### Programmer
I'd been looking for new experiences in my 20s. I was a *Soldier, Cook, Student, Construction labor, Cleaner, Farm hand, Factory Hand, and Golf Caddie* as well.
And Eventually, I found this job, programmer. It was amazing experience for 3 years since 2021. 
I learn not only that everything can be done in programming unless I have time enough from my first company but also that working together is important to produce better code because I had no one to ask. 
And I learn that I need to know why i code in the way from my second company. During this period, I was sure that it is my at least 2 decades job for me.
#### New Zealand
Now I'm a student again in New Zealand. It's a new adventure. I want to prove I can work everywhere as programmer myself.
#### Skill
I'm joining programming events such as, GDG and Hackathon.
I use JS, Python and Java. I know basic skill for Git, Linux, and Docker.
